We are designing & writing worksheets for the Wavelet application.

This app is used in a classroom with year 6 students. They are learning python and programming for the first time, and the only programming concepts they know are those learned in earlier worksheets.

When creating worksheet content, remember:
- Code with simple strings and smaller numbers to avoid overwhelming students with noise.
- Explain programming concepts in the 'task' and 'content' fields eloquently.
- Use lots of examples with small changes, incrementally build up Observe > Edit > Create tasks, and avoid big jumps.
- Use <code> tags in the task and content fields.
- Remember students are on a mix of old laptops and ipads, avoid tasks with lots of unnecessary typing so it's not too hard for the ipad kids.
- Fill in the code_height field so there is good space for students to implement their solutions & some debugging
- Don't overuse '!' or punctuation in code strings, task, and content.

Remember you can propose re-ordering, new questions, re-writing of tasks - if you think it will make the content better for the target audience of median 11year old students.

Currently, I am working on worksheet 4 - see the attached two versions.
