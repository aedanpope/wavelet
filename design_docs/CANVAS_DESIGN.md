# Canvas System Design

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Status:** Design Complete - Ready for Implementation
**Target Worksheet:** Worksheet 6

---

## Executive Summary

This document describes the design for a grid-based canvas drawing system for the Wavelet Zone platform. Students will use Python code to color cells on a grid using mathematical coordinates, learning loops and coordinate systems through visual feedback.

### Core Features
- Two grid sizes: **GRID3** (3x3) and **GRID100** (100x100)
- Simple Python API: `draw(x, y, color)`, `show()`, `clear()`
- Bottom-left coordinate system (like math: (0,0) is bottom-left)
- Visual output rendered above text output
- Automatic validation by comparing canvas states

---

## 1. Student-Facing API

### 1.1 Functions

```python
# Setup (provided in starter code)
use_canvas(GRID3)      # Initialize 3x3 canvas
use_canvas(GRID100)    # Initialize 100x100 canvas

# Drawing
draw(x, y)             # Draw black at coordinate (x, y)
draw(x, y, 'red')      # Draw with named color
draw(x, y, '#FF5733')  # Draw with hex color

# Control
show()                 # Flush drawings to screen (auto-called at end)
clear()                # Reset canvas to all white

# Constants
GRID3                  # 3x3 grid constant
GRID100                # 100x100 grid constant
```

### 1.2 Example Student Code

**GRID3 Example (Beginner):**
```python
use_canvas(GRID3)

# Draw a smiley face
draw(0, 2, 'yellow')   # Left eye
draw(2, 2, 'yellow')   # Right eye
draw(1, 0, 'red')      # Mouth
```

**GRID100 Example (Loops):**
```python
use_canvas(GRID100)

# Draw a horizontal rainbow
colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'purple']
for i in range(6):
    for x in range(100):
        draw(x, 50 + i, colors[i])
```

### 1.3 Color Support

**Supported Formats:**
- All CSS named colors (e.g., `'red'`, `'blue'`, `'hotpink'`, `'cornflowerblue'`)
- Hex codes (e.g., `'#FF0000'`, `'#00FF00'`)
- Default canvas background: white
- Default draw color: black

**Rationale:** Supporting all CSS colors gives students creative freedom while still being simple to use.

## 2. Coordinate System

### 2.1 Bottom-Left Origin (Math Convention)

```
GRID3 Coordinate System:

(0,2) (1,2) (2,2)    <-- Top row
(0,1) (1,1) (2,1)    <-- Middle row
(0,0) (1,0) (2,0)    <-- Bottom row (y=0)
  ^
  |
x=0 (left edge)
```

**Rationale:**
- [+] Matches mathematical Cartesian coordinates
- [+] Students can apply knowledge in math class
- [+] Y increases upward (natural for "up" = "bigger")
- [-] Different from array indexing [row][col]
- [-] Different from screen coordinates (top-left)
- **Decision:** Educational value of math convention outweighs short-term familiarity

### 2.2 Coordinate Labels

**GRID3:** Show coordinate labels on axes to help students learn
**GRID100:** Hide labels (too cluttered, students already know coordinates by then)

---

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Data Flow

```
Student Code (Python)          JavaScript Bridge          Browser DOM
---------------------          -----------------          -----------

use_canvas(GRID3)      --->    Initialize canvas state
                               Create <canvas> element  --->  Inject into output area

draw(1, 2, 'red')      --->    Add to command buffer
                               {type: 'draw', x: 1, y: 2, color: 'red'}

draw(0, 1, 'blue')     --->    Add to command buffer
                               {type: 'draw', x: 0, y: 1, color: 'blue'}

show()                 --->    Batch render all commands --->  Update canvas pixels
(or auto at end)               Clear command buffer

Validation:
  Run solution code    --->    Generate solution state
  Compare states       --->    Deep compare grid objects
  Return result        --->    Show feedback
```

### 3.2 Canvas State Storage

**Python-side internal state:**
```python
_canvas_state = {
    'grid': {},              # Sparse dict: {(x, y): 'color'}
    'size': 'GRID3',         # 'GRID3' or 'GRID100'
    'dimensions': (3, 3),    # (width, height)
    'commands': []           # [{type: 'draw', x, y, color}, ...]
}
```

**Why sparse dictionary:**
- [+] Efficient for GRID100 (only stores colored cells, not all 10,000)
- [+] Fast lookup: O(1) for checking cell color
- [+] Easy to compare two states (dict equality)
- [+] Small memory footprint for validation

**JavaScript rendering:**
- HTML5 `<canvas>` element (not DOM divs)
- Canvas 2D API for pixel drawing
- Batch rendering from command buffer

---

## 4. UI/UX Design

### 4.1 Canvas Sizing

**GRID3 (3x3):**
- Desktop: 360px x 360px (120px per cell)
- Mobile: 270px x 270px (90px per cell)
- Touch-friendly cell sizes
- Grid lines visible (dark border)

**GRID100 (100x100):**
- Desktop/Tablet: 500px x 500px (5px per cell)
- Mobile: 400px x 400px (4px per cell)
- Grid lines hidden (too cluttered)
- `image-rendering: pixelated` for crisp pixels

### 4.2 Responsive Layout

```css
.canvas-container {
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 500px;  /* GRID100 */
    aspect-ratio: 1;   /* Always square */
    margin: 0 auto;
}

canvas {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    border: 2px solid #667eea;
    border-radius: 8px;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .canvas-container {
        max-width: 90vw;  /* Smaller on mobile */
    }
}
```

### 4.3 Output Area Layout

```
+-------------------------------+
|  Problem Title                |
|  Problem Description          |
|  +----------+  +----------+   |
|  |  Code    |  | +------+ |   | <-- Canvas above
|  |  Editor  |  | |Canvas| |   |
|  |          |  | +------+ |   |
|  |          |  | ---------+   |
|  |          |  | Text     |   | <-- Text output below
|  |          |  | Output   |   |
|  +----------+  +----------+   |
+-------------------------------+
```

**Rationale:** Canvas above shows visual result first (primary focus), text output below shows print statements (secondary/debug).

---

## 5. Validation System

### 5.1 Strategy: Canvas State Comparison

Extend existing `solution_code` validation to automatically compare canvas states when `problem.canvas === true`.

```json
{
  "title": "Draw a horizontal line",
  "canvas": true,
  "validation": {
    "rules": [
      {
        "type": "solution_code",
        "solutionCode": "use_canvas(GRID3)\ndraw(0, 1)\ndraw(1, 1)\ndraw(2, 1)"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Validation Flow

```javascript
// In validation.js - extend validateSolutionCode()

async function validateSolutionCode(rule, studentCode, problem, codeExecutor) {
    // 1. Student code already ran, extract canvas state
    const studentCanvas = getCanvasState(codeExecutor, 'student');
    const studentOutput = getTextOutput(codeExecutor, 'student');

    // 2. Run solution code in fresh environment
    await resetEnvironment();
    await runSolutionCode(rule.solutionCode);
    const solutionCanvas = getCanvasState(codeExecutor, 'solution');
    const solutionOutput = getTextOutput(codeExecutor, 'solution');

    // 3. Compare text outputs (existing logic)
    const textMatches = (studentOutput === solutionOutput);

    // 4. NEW: Compare canvas states if canvas problem
    let canvasMatches = true;
    if (problem.canvas) {
        canvasMatches = deepEqual(studentCanvas.grid, solutionCanvas.grid);
    }

    // 5. Both must match
    if (textMatches && canvasMatches) {
        return { isValid: true, message: "Perfect! âœ“" };
    }

    // 6. Generate helpful feedback
    return {
        isValid: false,
        message: generateDiffFeedback(studentCanvas, solutionCanvas, textMatches)
    };
}
```

### 5.3 Feedback Generation

**Current Plan:** Simple feedback for MVP
- "Perfect!" - Both canvas and output match
- "Your canvas doesn't match the expected pattern." - Canvas mismatch
- "Your output is incorrect." - Text output mismatch

**Future Enhancement:** Smart diff analysis
```javascript
function generateDiffFeedback(studentGrid, solutionGrid) {
    const missing = findMissingCells(studentGrid, solutionGrid);
    const extra = findExtraCells(studentGrid, solutionGrid);
    const wrong = findWrongColors(studentGrid, solutionGrid);

    if (missing.length > 0) {
        return `You're missing ${missing.length} cell(s). Check the pattern carefully!`;
    }
    if (extra.length > 0) {
        return `You have ${extra.length} extra cell(s). Try removing some!`;
    }
    if (wrong.length > 0) {
        return `Some cells are the wrong color. Check your colors!`;
    }
}
```

## 6. Error Handling

### 6.1 Out-of-Bounds Coordinates

**Behavior:** Print friendly warning, don't crash, don't draw

```python
# Student code
use_canvas(GRID3)
draw(5, 5, 'red')  # Out of bounds

# Output
Warning: Oops! (5, 5) is outside the GRID3 canvas (3x3). Try smaller numbers!
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def draw(x, y, color='black'):
    width, height = _canvas_state['dimensions']
    if not (0 <= x < width and 0 <= y < height):
        print(f"Warning: Oops! ({x}, {y}) is outside the {_canvas_state['size']} canvas ({width}x{height}). Try smaller numbers!")
        return
    # ... proceed with drawing
```

### 6.2 Invalid Colors

**Behavior:** Print warning, use black as fallback

```python
draw(1, 1, 'not-a-color')
# Output: Warning: Color 'not-a-color' not recognized. Using black instead.
```

### 6.3 Missing use_canvas()

**Behavior:** Clear error message

```python
draw(1, 1)  # Before calling use_canvas()
# Output: Warning: You need to call use_canvas(GRID3) or use_canvas(GRID100) before drawing!
```

---

## 7. Performance Optimizations

### 7.1 Batching Draw Commands

**Problem:** Calling JavaScript from Python 10,000 times (GRID100) is slow

**Solution:** Batch commands, flush once

```python
# Student code
for y in range(100):
    for x in range(100):
        draw(x, y, 'blue')  # Adds to buffer, doesn't render yet

# After code completes (or on show())
# JavaScript: Render all 10,000 commands at once
```

**Implementation:**
```javascript
function flushCanvas(canvasState) {
    const ctx = canvasElement.getContext('2d');
    const cellSize = canvasElement.width / canvasState.dimensions[0];

    // Batch render all commands
    canvasState.commands.forEach(cmd => {
        ctx.fillStyle = cmd.color;
        // Flip Y coordinate for bottom-left origin
        const flippedY = canvasState.dimensions[1] - 1 - cmd.y;
        ctx.fillRect(cmd.x * cellSize, flippedY * cellSize, cellSize, cellSize);
    });

    // Clear buffer
    canvasState.commands = [];
}
```

### 7.2 Auto-flush Behavior

**When to flush:**
1. **Explicit `show()`** - Student calls it
2. **Auto at code completion** - After runCode() finishes
3. **Validation** - Before comparing states

**Why both manual and auto:**
- Beginners don't need to know about `show()` (auto-flush works)
- Advanced students can call `show()` multiple times for animations
- No confusion about "why isn't my canvas showing"

## 8. Implementation Scope

### 8.1 Files to Create

```
canvas-system.js               # New - Canvas Python-JS bridge
```

### 8.2 Files to Modify

## 9. Key Design Decisions & Tradeoffs

### 9.1 Grid Sizes: GRID3 vs GRID100

**Decision:** Use explicit size constants (GRID3, GRID100) instead of SMALL/LARGE

**Rationale:**
- [+] Students see exact dimensions (3x3, 100x100)
- [+] Reinforces concept of "grid" with width and height
- [+] Easy to add GRID10, GRID50 later
- [-] Longer to type than SMALL/LARGE
- **Verdict:** Educational clarity > brevity

### 9.2 Function Naming: draw() vs color_cell()

**Decision:** Use `draw()` instead of `color_cell()`

**Rationale:**
- [+] Only 4 characters (iPad-friendly)
- [+] Natural verb students know
- [+] Generalizable (could draw lines, shapes later)
- [-] Less specific than "color_cell"
- **Verdict:** Brevity and intuitiveness win

### 9.3 Coordinate System: Bottom-Left vs Top-Left

**Decision:** Bottom-left origin (math convention)

**Rationale:**
- [+] Matches Cartesian coordinates in math class
- [+] Y increasing upward is intuitive ("up" = "bigger")
- [+] Transferable knowledge to graphing, geometry
- [-] Different from array indexing [row][col]
- [-] Different from screen coordinates (top-left)
- **Verdict:** Long-term educational value outweighs short-term familiarity

### 9.4 Validation: State Comparison vs Pixel Comparison

**Decision:** Compare internal Python dict state, not canvas pixels

**Rationale:**
- [+] Fast and deterministic (no anti-aliasing issues)
- [+] Can provide specific feedback (which cells differ)
- [+] No HTML canvas needed for validation
- [+] Works with sparse storage (efficient for GRID100)
- [-] Doesn't catch rendering bugs
- **Verdict:** State comparison is simpler, faster, and more educational

### 9.5 Canvas Rendering: HTML Canvas vs DOM Grid

**Decision:** Use HTML5 `<canvas>` element, not DOM divs

**Rationale:**
- [+] Fast rendering for 10,000 cells (GRID100)
- [+] Built-in pixel manipulation
- [+] Smaller memory footprint
- [+] Can export as image (future feature)
- [-] Requires coordinate flipping for bottom-left origin
- **Verdict:** Performance requirements dictate canvas over DOM

### 9.6 Color Support: Limited vs Full CSS

**Decision:** Support all CSS named colors + hex codes

**Rationale:**
- [+] Creative freedom for students
- [+] Easy parsing (CSS parser built into browsers)
- [+] Students learn real web color formats
- [-] More error cases (typos in color names)
- **Verdict:** Educational value and creativity > simplicity

### 9.7 Auto-flush: Always vs Manual

**Decision:** Auto-flush at code completion + allow manual `show()`

**Rationale:**
- [+] Beginners don't need to know about `show()`
- [+] Advanced students can use `show()` for animations
- [+] Reduces confusion ("why isn't my canvas updating?")
- [-] Slight complexity in implementation
- **Verdict:** Better UX for all skill levels

### 9.8 Validation Feedback: Simple vs Detailed

**Decision:** Start with simple feedback, enhance later

**MVP:** "Your canvas doesn't match"
**Future:** "You're missing 3 cells" or "Cell (2, 1) should be red"

**Rationale:**
- [+] Simpler to implement for MVP
- [+] Can enhance incrementally based on student needs
- [+] Avoids giving away answers too easily
- **Verdict:** Ship simple, iterate based on feedback
